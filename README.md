# WhipperSnapper
Project for CodePath Android class.

WhipperSnapper is an app that connects senior citizens with volunteers to help them with tasks. Whether it's moving furniture, tech support, or just having a card-playing partner, WhipperSnapper provides individual help to enable seniors to live comfortably without expensive caretakers. WhipperSnapper is a TaskRabbit app powered by the good will of the community. Volunteers can help as frequently as they want according to their own availability, without the entrance barrier of long-term commitment.
